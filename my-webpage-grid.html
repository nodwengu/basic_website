                     <p>Over 60,000 of its inhabitants were forcibly removed during the 1970s by the apartheid regime.</p>
                     <p>Government officials portrayed the area as crime-ridden and dangerous; they claimed that the district was a vice den, full of immoral activities like gambling, drinking, and prostitution.</p>
                     <p>Though these were the official reasons, most residents believed that the government sought the land because of its proximity to the city centre, Table Mountain, and the harbour.</p>

                  <p>On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech after his release from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall.</p>

                     <p>Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.</p>
                     <p>During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and the former cells remain to this day.</p>
                     <p>The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, and today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments.</p>
