                  <p>Egyptians are friendly, genuine and easygoing, people.</p>
                  <p>Cairo (Al-Qahira): A city that’s home to the Pyramids, the Sphinx of Giza, the Egyptian National Museum, the beautiful Nile river and shopping in the Khan al Halili Bazaar.</p>
                  <p>Cairo is a city full of life, traditions, gastronomic surprises and culture. </p>
                  <p>Primary education is free and compulsory, and university tuition has been free since 1962.</p>
                  <p>In 1925, Cairo won the title of the most beautiful city in the world, even though European cities like Berlin, Paris and London were also competing.</p>
