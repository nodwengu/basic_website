                  <p>Egyptians are friendly, genuine and easygoing, people.</p>
                  <p>Cairo (Al-Qahira): A city that’s home to the Pyramids, the Sphinx of Giza, the Egyptian National Museum, the beautiful Nile river and shopping in the Khan al Halili Bazaar.</p>
                  <p>Cairo is a city full of life, traditions, gastronomic surprises and culture. </p>
                  <p>Primary education is free and compulsory, and university tuition has been free since 1962.</p>
                  <p>In 1925, Cairo won the title of the most beautiful city in the world, even though European cities like Berlin, Paris and London were also competing.</p>

                        <p>Over 60,000 of its inhabitants were forcibly removed during the 1970s by the apartheid regime.</p>
                        <p>Government officials portrayed the area as crime-ridden and dangerous; they claimed that the district was a vice den, full of immoral activities like gambling, drinking, and prostitution.</p>
                        <p>Though these were the official reasons, most residents believed that the government sought the land because of its proximity to the city centre, Table Mountain, and the harbour.</p>

                        <p>The building was designed as the result of a public competition and is built from honey-coloured oolitic limestone imported from Bath in England.</p>
                        <p>On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech after his release from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall.</p>
                        <p>The City Hall has become a central venue for creative and cultural events such as art exhibitions and concerts.</p>

                        <p>Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and the former cells remain to this day.</p>
                        <p>The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, and today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments.</p>
